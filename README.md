<h3>Log Loss Plot for the number of codewords v/s the Quantisation Loss</h3>

![Log_Quantisation_loss_3](https://github.com/vamsin07/ECE-228/assets/51058745/b4a41125-7c11-4ea9-8c01-226f0629a7df)

<h4>Here we look at the quantisation loss generated over the number of codewords for a Vector Quantisation Layer. As the the number of codewords increases(the distance) the quantisation loss is expected to decrease.</h4>

<h3>BER v/s SNR for Different Modulations</h3>

<h4>We generated a static dataset that returns the BER, SNR, transmitted and received bits, and we plotted the BER v/s SNR for the different modulation schemes.</h4>
